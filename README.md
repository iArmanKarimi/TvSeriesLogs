# TV Series Logs

A desktop application that helps you to keep logs of various TV series of your choice.

## Objective

The primary goals of this app are to manage the TV series:

1. seasons and episodes you are watching or are going to.
2. you are interested in watching or want to watch later.
3. you have watched.

It would be particularly helpful if you don't like to follow TV shows on schedule for any reason
and instead, you just watch them online or download them to watch later in your free time.
Note that you are not limited, and it could be generally used for literally any series of your choice.
